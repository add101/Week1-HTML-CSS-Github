# Week 1 Challenge 1: Code Refactor

## Task

Refactor code example for accessibility, and semantics

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

Your website must meet accessibility standards. You can achieve this completing the following:

* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
* HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
* Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

### Adjustments made to HTML and CSS:
-Changed div with id=header to \<header\> tag for clearer semantic taggin. Same for id=footer to footer 
-CSS adjusted footer instead of .footer

-Combined classes which had the same properties into one class, and adjusted tages in HTML

-Alt tags added to images

-Added Title
