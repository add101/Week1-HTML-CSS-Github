# Week 1 Challenge 1: Code Refactoring

## Task 

Refactor code example for accessibility, and semantics 

### Acceptance Criteria

The Acceptance Criteria given for Challenge:

"
* Semantic HTML elements can be found throughout the source code
*HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
*Image and icon elements contain accessible alt attributes
*Heading attributes fall in sequential order
*Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title

"
Semantic elements added to tags, instead of using generic divs
HTML elements stick to a logical structure that doesn't depend on fancy styles or positioning.
Make sure your image and icon elements have alt attributes that are easy to access.
Headings should line up in a logical order.
Keep your title elements short and sweet with a clear description.

### Adjustments made to HTML and CSS:
-Changed div with id=header to \<header\> tag for clearer semantic tagging. Same for id=footer to \<footer\> 
-CSS: adjusted footer instead of .footer

-Combined classes which had the same properties into one class, and adjusted tags in HTML

-Alt tags added to images (for accesibility, as well as SEO)

-Added Title
